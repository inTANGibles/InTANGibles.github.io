This conference paper presents the analysis of campus crowd behavior using location data and physical environment data from Southeast University Wuxi Campus. The work was presented at the CDRF 2024 conference on Symbiotic Intelligence, focusing on computational design and robotic fabrication applications.

The study on the behavior of on-campus individuals provides valuable insights for campus management, resource allocation, and planning layout. The application of multi-source data offers more objective and in-depth opportunities for exploring behavioral phenomena. Focusing on the Wuxi campus of Southeast University, this research utilized Wi-Fi probe positioning technology combined with a physical environment sensor system to comprehensively collect 28.87 million positioning data points and 340,000 environmental data points over a period of 14 days. After cleaning redundant, missing, abnormal, drifting, and ping-pong data, both types of data underwent visual analysis, and their correlations were studied. Additionally, trajectory feature extraction was conducted using a convolutional autoencoder neural network. The study revealed the temporal distribution of pedestrian flow, the spatial distribution of stopover behavior, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of pedestrian trajectories. This provides a reliable basis for guiding crowd behavior by improving specific campus areas and the physical environment.
