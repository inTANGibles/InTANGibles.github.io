This paper uses the standard design manuals for affordable housing in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenzhen as case studies. It conducts a comparative analysis of key design elements within these manuals, including the dimensions and layout of kitchen and bathroom fixtures, the area and proportion of functional spaces, and the assembly and combination of unit types. The study identifies commonalities and distinctive features in the standardized design elements across the manuals. Drawing on the development of affordable housing in Wuhan, it extracts suitable standardized design elements and proposes recommendations for establishing standards, thereby laying the groundwork for standardized design research in Wuhan's affordable housing sector.
