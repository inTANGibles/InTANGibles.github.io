With the deepening of urban renewal, urban design faces increasingly complex spatial conditions and diverse demands. Promoting sustainability and fairness has become a core goal. Although various digital tools for street design have emerged, most rely on top-down logic and lack parameter flexibility, making them unsuitable for old blocks with complex, dynamic structures. These tools also limit designers' participation and value expression during generation. To address the inefficiency of manual design and the lack of feedback in existing tools, this study proposes a framework for street network generation based on parameterized rules and multi-objective optimization. The framework integrates axisextraction, indicator evaluation, and genetic algorithm optimization, enabling designers to adjust weights and enhance human-computer collaboration and contextual adaptability. Thirty typical blocks in Chinese cities are selected for testing. A nine-indicator evaluation system is constructed, and the entropy weight method is used to determine weights. It also explores differences in network outcomes under different optimization objectives. The final optimization results are compared with manual and original schemes. Results show that the computer-generated schemes have certain advantages in maintaining spatial coherence and improving network accessibility. While reducing redundancy, they enhance overall efficiency, offering feasible design support for optimizing street networks in complex urban environments.
