I'm a second year postgraduate student from [School of Architecture](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Urban Computing, Digital Technology in Architecture, AI for Urban Design, and Human Behavior Simulation.

I am currently pursuing my Master of Architecture degree at Southeast University, with an exchange program at IUAV University of Venice in Urban Planning (Feb 2025 â€“ Jul 2025). I was previously a Bachelor of Architecture student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../cv/).
